Tuning:


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix:
- Redo level transitions at some point
- Optimize drawing circles
	- Maybe precalculate all points for the draw calls when creating
	- Then just loop through an array to draw all the points
	- I want to keep the line style for flexibility
	- Each type will need it's own creation function

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Polish:

- Extra electricity/something particles when out of energy
- Color bullets with an accent color (visible against blue, orang is obvious)
- Some extra flashing and stuff for player
	- Maybe shader or just manipulate surface color
	- Turbo
	- Shooting
	- Out of energy
- More popping style particles for when things progress or get done
	- Energy is full
	- Shoot circle progress particles
	
- More opportunities to use freeze command?
