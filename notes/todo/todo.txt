Tuning:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix:

- Move global volume arrays to files that get loaded when changing audio settings
	- Current implementation just leaves global values hanging around
	- This is not really needed, but would be a nice "peace of mind" -feature
- Remove global.levelProgressionArray
	- Could just be calculated every time player enters level select menu
	- This is also a "peace of mind" -feature and shouldn't really affect performance
- global.completedLevels could also just be loaded, saved and then dumped on runtime
	- Not a necessary optimization at this time
	
REMINDER TO SELF! ONLY OPTIMIZE IF NECESSARY!
